          Angkor Wat Khmer: is a temple complex in Cambodia, located on a site
          measuring 162.6 hectares (1,626,000 m2; 402 acres). The Guinness World
          Records considers it as the largest religious structure in the
          world.[2] Originally constructed as a Hindu temple dedicated to the
          god Vishnu for the Khmer Empire by King Suryavarman II during the 12th
          century, it was gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple towards
          the end of the century; as such, it is also described as a
          "Hindu-Buddhist" temple.

        <p class="parap2">
          The Great Wall of China  simplified
          is a series of fortifications that were built across
          the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial
          China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian
          Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century
          BC, with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang 
          the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5]
          Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple
          stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were
          built by the Ming dynasty   </p>
